# SQL Shell (psql)

When the server and client are in the same system then, we can simply press "_Enter_" to accept the defaults :

```shell
Server [localhost]:
Database [postgres]:
Port [5432]:
Username [postgres]:
Password for user postgres:
```

The default database is `postgres` when we opened it for the first time.

default port : 5432

After giving the correct password, we enter into the `postgre` database.

To get the current version information of the Postgre SQL:

```sql
SELECT version();
```

To get the current date & time info :

```sql
SELECT now();
```

To create a database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE favoritecolors;
```

To see all the databases present in the server:

```shell
\l
```

To switch database to recently created database :

```shell
\c favoritecolors
```

To add table :

```sql
CREATE TABLE colors (ColorID int, ColorName char(20));
```

To add data into the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO colors VALUES
(1,'Red'),
(2, 'Blue'),
(3,'Green');
```

To view the table :

```sql
SELECT * FROM colors;
```

# Linear Model

Three things are required to build a **linear model** or, **linear regression model** :

1. Predict Value : The variable value that we need to estimate
2. Relationship : Variables related in someway.
3. Historical Data : This is essential for extracting the linear equation for predicting a variable when others are given.

In a linear regression model :

```
y = mx + c
```

Where,
`y` : Value to be predicted
`m` : Slope
`x` : Known variable
`c` : Intercept

So, we need to find the slope and intercept between the two variables to generate the linear model.

In SQL,

`regr_intercept()` and `regr_slope()` functions are used to calculate the intercept and slope respectively between the two variable.

**_Example-1 :_**
Calculating the slope and intercept between the `employee_shifts` and `units_sold` :

```sql
SELECT
	REGR_INTERCEPT(employee_shifts, units_sold) AS intercept,
	REGR_SLOPE(employee_shifts, units_sold) AS slope
FROM
	store_sales;
```

**_Example-2 :_**
Predict the "**employee_shifts**" when the "**units_sold = 1250**" :

```sql
SELECT
	REGR_SLOPE(employee_shifts, units_sold)* 1250 + REGR_INTERCEPT(employee_shifts, units_sold) AS predicted_value
FROM
	store_sales;
```

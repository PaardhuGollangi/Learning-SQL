# Basic Descriptive Statistics

## Counting

To count the number of rows present in the table :

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales;
```

To count number of rows present in each month :

```sql
SELECT
	month_of_year,
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	store_sales
GROUP BY
	month_of_year
ORDER BY
	month_of_year;
```

## Maximum & Minimum

To find the maximum number of employee working on any shift:

```sql
SELECT
	MAX(employee_shifts)
FROM
	store_sales;
```

similarly, to find the minimum number of employee working on any shift:

```sql
SELECT
	MIN(employee_shifts)
FROM
	store_sales;
```

To find the maximum and minimum employees working on any shift by each month:

```sql
SELECT
	month_of_year,
	MAX(employee_shifts),
	MIN(employee_shifts)
FROM
	store_sales
GROUP BY
	month_of_year
ORDER BY
	month_of_year;
```

## Summation & Average

To find out the total number of items sold:

```sql
SELECT SUM(units_sold) FROM store_sales;
```

To find out the total and average number of items sold by each month:

```sql
SELECT
	month_of_year,
	SUM(units_sold),
	AVG(units_sold)
FROM
	store_sales
GROUP BY
	month_of_year
ORDER BY
	month_of_year;
```

## Variance & Standard Deviation

To find out the population variance and standard deviation of the number of items sold by each month:

```sql
SELECT
	month_of_year,
	VAR_POP(units_sold),
	STDDEV_POP(units_sold)
FROM
	store_sales
GROUP BY
	month_of_year
ORDER BY
	month_of_year;
```

## Rounding-off & Renaming

To get a basic statistical summary of the number of items sold by each month, rounded up to 2 decimal places and with intuitive names, we can write the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
	month_of_year,
	SUM(units_sold) AS Total_items_sold,
	ROUND(AVG(units_sold),2) AS rounded_average,
	ROUND(VAR_POP(units_sold),2) AS rounded_variance,
	ROUND(STDDEV_POP(units_sold),2) AS rounded_std_dev
FROM
	store_sales
GROUP BY
	month_of_year
ORDER BY
	month_of_year;
```

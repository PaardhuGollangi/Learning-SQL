# Percentile & Frequencies

**Percentiles** are one hundred equal groups in the data with the population of values divided across the groups.

It helps us in understanding the data more clearly, by grouping the data in the equal sized buckets.

There are two types of percentiles :

1. Discrete Percentiles
2. Continuous Percentiles

## Discrete & Continuous Percentiles

The **discrete percentile** returns the first value existed in the data that exceeds the given percentile.

Whereas, the **continuous percentile** defines the percentiles based on the dataset.

So, it interpolates and sets the boundary value between the percentiles in the data.

In summary, the discrete percentile is the value that we can find in the dataset but, the continuous percentile gets computed.

We are much likely to see a small difference in the values of discrete and continuous percentiles.

**_Example-1 :_**
The following SQL query shows the values obtained from discrete and continuous percentiles on the '_revenue_' column:

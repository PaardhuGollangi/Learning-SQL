# Managing Databases

To manage multiple databases, the four primary things that we need to know are as follows :

1. Creating databases
2. Viewing databases
3. Selecting database
4. Removing database

## Creating Database

A database can be created by using the `CREATE` Statement :

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name
```

## Viewing Database

We can view all the databases we have by using the `SHOW` Statement :

```sql
SHOW DATABASES
```

## Selecting Database

We can select a database to work upon by using the `USE` statement :

```sql
USE database_name
```

## Removing Database

We can completely remove a database along with all of its objects by using the `DROP` statement :

```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name
```
